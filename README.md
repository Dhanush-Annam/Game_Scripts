## 🌟 About the Project

**Game_Scripts** is a community-driven project by [@devmalik7](https://github.com/devmalik7).  
The goal is simple — learn, create, and share **fun little games** built using core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, randomization, and functions.

Each game lives inside its own folder with a small **README**, making it easy to explore and learn from.
