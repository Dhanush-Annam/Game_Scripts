🐍 Snake Game – Pygame Edition
🎮 Overview

This is a modernized Snake Game built using Python’s Pygame library.
The goal is simple — control the snake, eat the food, and grow as long as possible without hitting the walls or yourself!

It features a smooth user interface, gradient visuals, and a restart option, making it more polished than the classic console-based versions.

🧠 How It Works

The game uses a grid-based system with collision detection.

Each time the snake eats food, its length increases and its speed slightly rises.

The background is drawn dynamically with a vertical gradient for a clean, modern look.

The game resets smoothly after pressing R on the Game Over screen.
